# BUILDING:
First, git clone the code (git clone https://github.com/2003FordFocus/InternetRecoveryDownloader.git) or download a .zip file contaning it, and extract this into your Downloads folder.

Then you have two options, you can either open the .sln file with Visual Studio for the correct development settings and then import the .cpp file and build, *or* you can simply import InternetRecoveryDownloader.cpp into your desired C++ editor.

Then you can use Visual Studio or your preferred IDE to build the C++ from source for Linux or macOS (deprecated?).
